# 📊 Data Science & Business Intelligence Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! I am a Data professional with a Master's in Data Science and Analytics, specializing in building end-to-end data pipelines, ETL automation, and highly actionable business dashboards. 

Below is a collection of my projects ranging from automated data engineering to exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 🏆 Featured Project: End-to-End Retail Business Intelligence Pipeline
**Tools Used:** PostgreSQL, n8n (ETL Automation), Metabase, Data Visualization (Power BI/Tableau)

**Project Overview:**
Designed and deployed a complete Business Intelligence solution to analyze retail sales performance (Adidas dataset). This project encompasses the entire data lifecycle, from database extraction to executive dashboarding.

*   **ETL & Data Engineering (n8n):** Built an automated workflow to ingest raw relational data from a PostgreSQL database. Merged distinct `Product`, `Retailers`, and `Sales` tables into a unified dataset.
*   **Data Cleaning:** Engineered a cleaning node to resolve data type inconsistencies (e.g., converting `Operating_profit` from String to Integer) to ensure downstream data integrity.
*   **Executive Dashboards (Metabase & BI Tools):** Developed interactive dashboards to track KPIs including $148M+ Total Revenue and 2.4M+ Total Units Sold. 
*   **Business Insights:** Visualized revenue distribution across sales channels (Online, Outlet, In-store), evaluated top-performing retailers (West Gear, Foot Locker, Sports Direct), and tracked operating profit by geographical region.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization Projects

### 🚲 Urban Mobility: Bike Share Demand Analysis
*   **Seoul Bike Rental 2018:** Created small multiple bar charts to analyze hourly bike rental demand across weekdays and seasons (Autumn, Spring, Summer, Winter). Identified peak rental hours and seasonal usage variations.
*   **Average Rented Bike Patterns:** Visualized daily and holiday rental patterns. Differentiated weekday usage from holiday usage to identify recurring trends and predict future rental demand.
*   **Cyclistic Customer Bike Usage:** Developed a spatial heatmap depicting trip counts between start and end zip codes. Mapped the flow of rentals to showcase popular routes and areas of high transportation network strain.

### 📱 Social Media Insights: TikTok Claim Classification (EDA)
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a TikTok dataset to identify features for a machine learning classification model.
*   Investigated the correlation between video views, likes, comments, and duration.
*   Analyzed the distribution of "claims" vs. "opinions" and cross-referenced this with author ban statuses to understand content moderation patterns.

### 🌍 Geospatial & Environmental Analysis
*   **Lightning Strikes in the U.S.:** Mapped historical lightning strike data using scatter plots and density maps. Highlighted geographic clusters, year-over-year trends, and maximum strike zones to identify high-risk areas.
*   **Global CO2 Emissions:** Designed a choropleth world map tracking CO2 emissions per capita from 2000 to 2011. Visualized global disparities and carbon footprint distributions on a national scale.

### 🚗 Traffic & Infrastructure
*   **Minnesota Traffic Volume:** Built a combined visualization suite analyzing monthly seasonal traffic patterns, the impact of varying weather conditions, and hourly traffic dips/spikes during US National Holidays.

### 🏡 Real Estate: Airbnb Pricing (Athens, Greece)
*   Combined spatial mapping with bar charts to analyze Airbnb rental properties across Athens. Correlated geographic locations with average neighbourhood pricing to identify premium rental zones and market variations.
